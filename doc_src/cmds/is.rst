Description
-----------

``is`` checks if conditions are true. It operates on lists of arguments. The first argument is the command.

A missing or unknown command is an error.

All commands except ``empty`` return false if no argument was passed.

Unlike ``test``, ``is`` does not support logical operators and lacks some negated forms. Use :ref:`combiners <combiners>` and multiple calls to ``is`` instead.

``is`` prints the help when given ``-h`` or ``--help` as the first argument.

.. _cmd-is-strings:

String commands
---------------

- ``empty`` checks if all given strings are empty. This returns true if no string was given.
- ``notempty`` checks if all given strings are notempty.
- ``same`` checks if all the given strings are the same. This returns false if only one string was given.
- ``number`` checks if all the given strings are numbers that ``is`` understands. See :ref:`Number commands <cmd-is-numbers>` for more details.

To check if any string is not empty, negate the ``is`` instead: ``not is empty "" "" "foo"`` will be true.

To check if a string has one of a number of given values, use :ref:`contains <cmd-contains>`: ``contains -- foo bar foo baz``.

.. _cmd-is-files:

File and directory commands
---------------------------

- ``path`` checks if all given paths exist.
- ``file`` checks if all given paths are regular files.
- ``directory`` checks if all given paths are directories.
- ``link`` checks if all given paths are symbolic links.
- ``readable`` checks if all given paths are readable.
- ``writable`` checks if all given paths are writable.
- ``executable`` checks if all given paths are executable.

.. _cmd-is-numbers:

Number commands
---------------

``is`` can compare floating point numbers.

- The radix character is ``.``, not dependent on locale.
- It ignores leading and trailing whitespace, leading zeroes, trailing zeroes after a "."
- It can handle hexadecimal numbers with ``0x``.

See also the ``number`` command (under :ref:`String commands <cmd-is-strings>`) to check if something is a number in this sense.

All of these commands return false if less than two numbers were given. A number isn't equal to, greater than or less than nothing.

- ``equal`` checks if all given numbers are numerically equal
- ``greater`` checks if every number is greater than the next, i.e. the numbers are in strictly descending order.
- ``less`` checks if every number is smaller than the next, i.e. they are in strictly ascending order.
- ``greater-equal``, like ``greater``, but also true if the numbers are equal.
- ``less-equal``, like ``less``, but also true if the numbers are equal.

The command names are chosen after the operator that would be put between the operands, so::

  is greater 2 1 # compares 2 > 1
  is less 1 2 3 4 5 # compares 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5

Examples
--------

From __fish_complete_docutils::

  if is same $cmd rst2html5
      complete -x -c $cmd -l table-style -a "borderless booktabs align-left align-center align-right colwidths-auto" -d "Specify table style"

From fish_vi_cursor::
  
  # With test - this:
  # - needs to test if $KONSOLE_VERSION is non-empty before checking if it's greater
  # - needs to quote $KONSOLE_VERSION because `test -n` is *true*
  # - still errors out if $KONSOLE_VERSION is non-numeric
  not test -n "$KONSOLE_VERSION" -a "$KONSOLE_VERSION" -ge 200400

  # With is - no error when the argument is not numeric or missing.
  not is greater $KONSOLE_VERSION 200400

From __fish_complete_man::

  if test -z "$section" -o "$section" = 1

  if is empty $section; or is same $section 1


  if test -z "$token" -a "$section" != "[^)]*"

  if is empty $token; and not is same $section "[^)]*"

__fish_md5::

  # Note: This either needs to be quoted or needs to have been checked beforehand.
  if test $argv[1] = -s

  if is same $argv[1] -s

  if is = $argv[1] -s

oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/pkg/omf/omf.update.fish::

  # Will error out if $OMF_PATH, $OMF_CONFIG or $name aren't set
  if test \( -e $OMF_PATH/themes/$name \) -o \( -e $OMF_CONFIG/themes/$name \)

  # Will just be false if they are unset
  if is path $OMF_PATH/themes/$name; or is path $OMF_CONFIG/themes/$name

Ideas
-----

- Version comparison using ``vercmp``
- ``is true`` - check if a value is "truthy" - number greater than 0, a string like "ON" or "true".
- ``is number`` - check if the value is a number.
- ``--any``, before the command, to return true if any value is true.
- Remove ``notempty``? Add ``notequal``?
- Other names for numeric commands? ``=``?
- Allow the test option naming, possibly as an alternative? "lt"/"le"/"gt"/"ge"?
- ``is prefix``, checking if the first argument is prefix of all the others? (same for suffix etc)

Unimplemented bits:

Some operators for files that nobody really uses much
-----------------------------------------------------

- ``-b FILE`` returns true if ``FILE`` is a block device.

- ``-c FILE`` returns true if ``FILE`` is a character device.

- ``-g FILE`` returns true if ``FILE`` has the set-group-ID bit set.

- ``-G FILE`` returns true if ``FILE`` exists and has the same group ID as the current user.

- ``-k FILE`` returns true if ``FILE`` has the sticky bit set. If the OS does not support the concept it returns false. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bit.

- ``-O FILE`` returns true if ``FILE`` exists and is owned by the current user.

- ``-p FILE`` returns true if ``FILE`` is a named pipe.

- ``-s FILE`` returns true if the size of ``FILE`` is greater than zero.

- ``-S FILE`` returns true if ``FILE`` is a socket.

- ``-t FD`` returns true if the file descriptor ``FD`` is a terminal (TTY).

- ``-u FILE`` returns true if ``FILE`` has the set-user-ID bit set.

Operators to compare and examine numbers
----------------------------------------

- ``NUM1 -ne NUM2`` returns true if ``NUM1`` and ``NUM2`` are not numerically equal.

Operators to combine expressions
--------------------------------

- ``COND1 -a COND2`` returns true if both ``COND1`` and ``COND2`` are true.

- ``COND1 -o COND2`` returns true if either ``COND1`` or ``COND2`` are true.

Expressions can be inverted using the ``!`` operator:

- ``! EXPRESSION`` returns true if ``EXPRESSION`` is false, and false if ``EXPRESSION`` is true.

Expressions can be grouped using parentheses.

- ``( EXPRESSION )`` returns the value of ``EXPRESSION``.

 Note that parentheses will usually require escaping with ``\(`` to avoid being interpreted as a command substitution.
